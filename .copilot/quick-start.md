# ðŸš€ Quick Start: Generate Your AKS Workload Identity Environment

## Copy and Paste This Into GitHub Copilot Chat

```
Generate a complete Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) environment with workload identity based on the following specifications:

PROJECT SETTINGS:
- project_name: "myproject" (change this - max 10 chars, lowercase alphanumeric)
- environment: "dev"
- location: "East US" (change to your preferred Azure region)
- subscription_id: "your-subscription-guid"

ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:
âœ… AKS cluster with Azure AD integration and Azure RBAC
âœ… Workload Identity for secure pod-to-Azure authentication
âœ… Three separate User Assigned Managed Identities (kubelet, cluster, workload)
âœ… Azure Container Registry with managed identity integration
âœ… Azure Storage Account for application data
âœ… Automatic Entra ID group creation with current user as admin
âœ… Microsoft Azure naming conventions with region abbreviations
âœ… Three-tier resource group strategy (app, nodes, backend state)
âœ… Two-phase deployment to handle Kubernetes provider dependencies

SECURITY FEATURES:
- local_account_disabled = true (Azure AD only)
- azure_rbac_enabled = true
- workload_identity_enabled = true
- oidc_issuer_enabled = true
- Comprehensive role assignments for cluster access
- Network security groups
- Current user automatically granted cluster admin access

NAMING PATTERN: {project}-{environment}-{region}-{resource-type}
Examples:
- Resource Group: myproject-dev-eus-rg
- AKS Cluster: myproject-dev-eus-aks
- Storage Account: myprojectdeveusst
- Container Registry: myprojectdeveuscr
- Admin Group: myproject-dev-eus-aks-admins

INFRASTRUCTURE MODULES NEEDED:
1. infra/tf/main.tf - Root configuration with locals and naming
2. infra/tf/variables.tf - All variables with validation
3. infra/tf/outputs.tf - Comprehensive outputs
4. infra/tf/terraform.tfvars - Default values
5. infra/tf/backend.hcl.template - Backend configuration
6. infra/tf/modules/aks/ - AKS cluster with security features
7. infra/tf/modules/storage/ - Storage account and containers
8. infra/tf/modules/container_registry/ - ACR with managed identity
9. infra/tf/modules/managed_identity/ - Three UAMIs
10. infra/tf/modules/workload_identity/ - Federated credentials and service accounts

AUTOMATION SCRIPTS NEEDED:
- deploy.sh: Two-phase deployment with error handling
- validate.sh: Comprehensive validation
- cleanup.sh: Safe resource destruction

DOCUMENTATION NEEDED:
- README.md: Complete setup instructions
- NAMING.md: Naming conventions guide
- examples/: Test pods demonstrating workload identity

Generate all files with complete, working Terraform code following Azure best practices.
```

## After Generation: Customize These Files

### 1. Update `infra/tf/terraform.tfvars`
```hcl
project_name         = "myproject"  # CHANGE THIS
environment          = "dev"
location             = "East US"    # CHANGE THIS
subscription_id      = "your-guid" # CHANGE THIS
kubernetes_version   = "1.30.12"
node_count          = 3
vm_size             = "Standard_B2s"
```

### 2. Deploy
```bash
cd infra/tf
chmod +x *.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### 3. Test
```bash
kubectl get nodes
kubectl apply -f examples/test-pod.yaml
./validate.sh
```
